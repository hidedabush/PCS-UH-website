// KNOWN LIMITATION: these assume the 5 landing sections are equal-height,
// so "stop 1" (mission) lands exactly at 25% of total scroll. They aren't
// (Hero is a fixed min-h-screen; Mission/Offerings/GitHub/FinalCTA are
// content-sized), so in practice the pose at Mission's actual scroll
// position is a blend between stop 1 and stop 2, not pure stop-1 values —
// tuning TX/TZ/ZOOM here gets you close but not exact. A future pass
// should compute real stop fractions from each section's measured
// offsetTop/scrollHeight instead of assuming quarters.

// in the left column (lg:col-span-5, first) with the pillar list on the

// just turns in place.

// viewport at render time — see `lateralScale` in GpuCard below.
